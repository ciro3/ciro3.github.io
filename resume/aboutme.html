I am a seasoned professional with 18 years of experience in environmental management, including five as Supervisor of the Kelowna-Vernon Regional Biosolids Compost Facility (RBCF). I have experience ensuring compliance with regulations, operating and management plans, best practices, and guidelines related to compost operations and organics recycling. I am skilled at developing and evaluating bidding documents, internal control documents and financial documents, considering cost-benefit, risk mitigation, and sustainable purchasing principles. I contributed to the development of the City's Asset Management Plan and the adoption of an asset management system for our operation. In 2020, I helped develop the City of Kelownaâ€™s Civic Operations Strategic Plan. As a qualified professional in the field, I am actively involved in promoting responsible waste management. I am a registered Professional Agrologist who has experience in environmental resource protection, regulatory support, waste compost operations, and human resource management. I possess strong interpersonal skills and experience in media and public relations, and I have a history of fostering collaborative working relationships.
