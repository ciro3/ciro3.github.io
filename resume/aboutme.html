I am a seasoned professional with engineering and environmental science degrees, and 18 years of experience in environmental management, including five as Supervisor of the Kelowna-Vernon Regional Biosolids Compost Facility (RBCF).

In my current role I ensure compliance with our operating and management plans, operating permit and regulatory requirements under the Organic Matter Recycling Regulation and Environmental Management Act, in addition to best practices and guidelines related to compost operations and organics recycling. I also facilitate meetings, provide technical advice, and report to the Biosolids Advisory Committee (BAC), which includes elected officials from Kelowna and Vernon.

I bring experience successfully managing a $3 million annual operating budget and developing business cases to secure approximately $5 million for renewal or replacement of capital assets and to comply with regulatory requirements. I am skilled in developing and evaluating bidding documents (e.g., RFPs), internal control documents (e.g., requisitions and purchase orders), and financial documents (e.g., invoices), and consider cost-benefit, risk mitigation, and sustainable purchasing principles when evaluating proposals and negotiating contracts. 

I contributed to the development of the City's Asset Management Plan and the adoption of an asset management system (CityWorks) for our operation, to make better infrastructure asset decisions that minimize risk and cost and maximize service delivery. In 2020, I helped develop the City of Kelowna’s Civic Operations Strategic Plan, focused on environmental protection, customer service, risk mitigation and life cycle analysis of projects. In 2022, I was a member of the Steering Committee that helped develop the City’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategic Plan, and I helped present the plan to the Senior Leadership Team.

As a qualified professional in the field, I am actively involved in promoting responsible waste management through my participation in the Circular Cities & Regions Initiative, as an instructor of SWANA BC’s Compost Operator Course, and as member of the Technical Working Group for biosolids and compost management on behalf of the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. I have also been a registered Professional Agrologist for 12 years, specializing in environmental resource protection, regulatory support, waste compost operations, and human resource management.

In addition to my technical qualifications, I possess strong interpersonal skills and experience in media and public relations. I have a history of fostering collaborative working relationships with management, municipal partners, industry, regulators, academia, and other local governments. I cultivate a positive and respectful workplace culture, mentor and develop team members, and effectively manage challenging employees, resulting in high satisfaction scores from my staff in a 2019 employee engagement survey. Over the past five years at RBCF, I have significantly improved neighbor relations through active listening, proactive communication and accommodating operational changes, which have resulted in praise from neighbors, management, and BAC members for achieving a 97% reduction in the number of annual odour complaints.

I am particularly eager to help maximize the beneficial use of waste materials, divert and recycle more organics, and explore the use of renewable energy through innovation and building of collaborative partnerships. I am confident that my qualifications, experience, and skills make me a strong candidate for the role and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further with you.
