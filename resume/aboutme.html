Letter excerpt he wrote:
I am Jose, a seasoned professional with engineering and environmental science degrees, and 18 years of experience in environmental management, including five as Supervisor of the Kelowna-Vernon Regional Biosolids Compost Facility (RBCF).

In my current role I ensure compliance with our operating and management plans, operating permit and regulatory requirements under the Organic Matter Recycling Regulation and Environmental Management Act, in addition to best practices and guidelines related to compost operations and organics recycling. I also facilitate meetings, provide technical advice, and report to the Biosolids Advisory Committee (BAC), which includes elected officials from Kelowna and Vernon.

I bring experience successfully managing a $3 million annual operating budget and developing business cases to secure approximately $5 million for renewal or replacement of capital assets and to comply with regulatory requirements. I am skilled in developing and evaluating bidding documents (e.g., RFPs), internal control documents (e.g., requisitions and purchase orders), and financial documents (e.g., invoices), and consider cost-benefit, risk mitigation, and sustainable purchasing principles when evaluating proposals and negotiating contracts. 

I contributed to the development of the City's Asset Management Plan and the adoption of an asset management system (CityWorks) for our operation, to make better infrastructure asset decisions that minimize risk and cost and maximize service delivery. In 2020, I helped develop the City of Kelowna‚Äôs Civic Operations Strategic Plan, focused on environmental protection, customer service, risk mitigation and life cycle analysis of projects. In 2022, I was a member of the Steering Committee that helped develop the City‚Äôs Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategic Plan, and I helped present the plan to the Senior Leadership Team.

As a qualified professional in the field, I am actively involved in promoting responsible waste management through my participation in the Circular Cities & Regions Initiative, as an instructor of SWANA BC‚Äôs Compost Operator Course, and as member of the Technical Working Group for biosolids and compost management on behalf of the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. I have also been a registered Professional Agrologist for 12 years, specializing in environmental resource protection, regulatory support, waste compost operations, and human resource management.

In addition to my technical qualifications, I possess strong interpersonal skills and experience in media and public relations. I have a history of fostering collaborative working relationships with management, municipal partners, industry, regulators, academia, and other local governments. I cultivate a positive and respectful workplace culture, mentor and develop team members, and effectively manage challenging employees, resulting in high satisfaction scores from my staff in a 2019 employee engagement survey. Over the past five years at RBCF, I have significantly improved neighbor relations through active listening, proactive communication and accommodating operational changes, which have resulted in praise from neighbors, management, and BAC members for achieving a 97% reduction in the number of annual odour complaints.

Jose's management style and examples:

My management style is a transformational management style, based on three principles: leading by example, open communication, and collaboration. I believe that a good manager should provide clear direction and guidance to their staff, communicate effectively with all stakeholders, and foster a cooperative, respectful and supportive work environment.

In my current role as Supervisor of the Kelowna-Vernon Regional Biosolids Compost Facility (RBCF), I have demonstrated strong leadership skills by managing a team of direct reports, including heavy equipment operators and environmental technicians, support staff, contractors, and consultants. I have developed and maintained capital plans and operating budgets, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements under the Organic Matter Recycling Regulation and the Environmental Management Act for compost operations. Additionally, I have facilitated meetings with and reported to the Kelowna-Vernon Biosolids Advisory Committee, which includes elected officials from Kelowna and Vernon. I have also provided regular feedback and coaching to my staff, mentoring them on their professional development and fostering a positive and respectful workplace culture.

As a result of my management style, I was able to achieve several outcomes that benefited both my team and the organization. For example:

üè≠ "Leading by Example" - Successfully led a high-performing team of direct reports, contractors, and consultants to ensure compliance with operating plans, best practices, and guidelines, as well as operating permit requirements under the Organic Matter Recycling Regulation and the Environmental Management Act for compost operations.

üíº "Cost-conscious & Environmentally Responsible" - Demonstrated expertise in developing and evaluating bidding documents, internal control documents, and financial documents, considering cost-benefit, risk mitigation, and sustainable purchasing principles when evaluating proposals and negotiating contracts.

ü§ù "Creating a Positive Work Culture" - Fostered a positive and respectful workplace culture, mentoring and developing team members, and effectively managing challenging employees, resulting in high satisfaction scores from your staff in a 2019 employee engagement survey.

üè¢ "Ensuring Smooth Operations" - Made significant contributions to the development of the City's Asset Management Plan and the adoption of an asset management system (CityWorks) for our operation, leading to improved infrastructure asset decisions and minimized risk and cost while maximizing service delivery.

üëÉ "Improving Community Relations" - Achieved a 97% reduction in annual odour complaints by proactively improving neighbor relations through active listening, effective communication, and accommodating operational changes, resulting in praise from neighbors, management, and committee members.

there are eight key management behaviors that stimulate the production of oxytocin and foster a culture of trust. These behaviors are:

1. Recognize excellence
2. Induce "challenge stress"
3. Give people discretion in how they do their work
4. Enable job crafting
5. Share information broadly
6. Intentionally build relationships
7. Facilitate whole-person growth
8. Show vulnerability
