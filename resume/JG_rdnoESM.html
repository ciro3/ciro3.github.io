Jose's application cover letter:
January 29, 2023
RE:    MANAGER, ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES - COMPETITION NO. 23-04
Please accept my application for Manager, Environmental Services at the RDNO. I am a seasoned professional with engineering and environmental science degrees, and 18 years of experience in environmental management, including five as Supervisor of the Kelowna-Vernon Regional Biosolids Compost Facility (RBCF).

In my current role I ensure compliance with our operating and management plans, operating permit and regulatory requirements under the Organic Matter Recycling Regulation and Environmental Management Act, in addition to best practices and guidelines related to compost operations and organics recycling. I also facilitate meetings, provide technical advice, and report to the Biosolids Advisory Committee (BAC), which includes elected officials from Kelowna and Vernon.

I bring experience successfully managing a $3 million annual operating budget and developing business cases to secure approximately $5 million for renewal or replacement of capital assets and to comply with regulatory requirements. I am skilled in developing and evaluating bidding documents (e.g., RFPs), internal control documents (e.g., requisitions and purchase orders), and financial documents (e.g., invoices), and consider cost-benefit, risk mitigation, and sustainable purchasing principles when evaluating proposals and negotiating contracts. 

I contributed to the development of the City's Asset Management Plan and the adoption of an asset management system (CityWorks) for our operation, to make better infrastructure asset decisions that minimize risk and cost and maximize service delivery. In 2020, I helped develop the City of Kelowna’s Civic Operations Strategic Plan, focused on environmental protection, customer service, risk mitigation and life cycle analysis of projects. In 2022, I was a member of the Steering Committee that helped develop the City’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategic Plan, and I helped present the plan to the Senior Leadership Team.

As a qualified professional in the field, I am actively involved in promoting responsible waste management through my participation in the Circular Cities & Regions Initiative, as an instructor of SWANA BC’s Compost Operator Course, and as member of the Technical Working Group for biosolids and compost management on behalf of the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. I have also been a registered Professional Agrologist for 12 years, specializing in environmental resource protection, regulatory support, waste compost operations, and human resource management.

In addition to my technical qualifications, I possess strong interpersonal skills and experience in media and public relations. I have a history of fostering collaborative working relationships with management, municipal partners, industry, regulators, academia, and other local governments. I cultivate a positive and respectful workplace culture, mentor and develop team members, and effectively manage challenging employees, resulting in high satisfaction scores from my staff in a 2019 employee engagement survey. Over the past five years at RBCF, I have significantly improved neighbor relations through active listening, proactive communication and accommodating operational changes, which have resulted in praise from neighbors, management, and BAC members for achieving a 97% reduction in the number of annual odour complaints.

The objectives of the RDNO Solid Waste Management Plan align with my own experience and interest in supporting the circular economy. I am particularly eager to help maximize the beneficial use of waste materials, divert and recycle more organics, and explore the use of renewable energy through innovation and building of collaborative partnerships. I am confident that my qualifications, experience, and skills make me a strong candidate for the role and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further with you.

Thank you for your consideration.

Email from RDNO inviting Jose for a personal interview:

Hi Jose,

 

We look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, April 4th @ 11:00 AM PST at the RDNO office, 9848 Aberdeen Road in Coldstream for the position of Manager, Environmental Services.

You will be interviewing with:
-          Tanis Stoltz, Manager, Human Resources
-          Ian Wilson, General Manager, Strategic and Community Services
-          David Sewell, Chief Administrative Officer

In preparation for the interview, please prepare a 10 minute presentation on the following topic:

The RDNO SWMP states a target annual disposal rate of 350kg per person by 2028, which is significantly lower than the current rate of approximately 490kg. Please provide an overview of three strategies that would make significant impacts in contributing to RDNO reaching its disposal rate by 2028.

==========
Jose's salary thoughts:
$124,000 is what I want and believe I deserve it based on exceeding the minimum requirements, although I haven't been in a similar position before, so start with $124,500.
other types of compensation to consider:
- professional development
- membership and licences for professional associations
- 5 weeks vacation
- every second friday off
- option to work from home at least 1 day every couple of weeks
- laptop
each working-from-home day (no commute) works out to ~ $2000 per year. So with 1 WFH day every two weeks (with friday off second week) works out to no commute 1day per week, I could accept $122,500.

=====
Jose's management style and examples:

My management style is a transformational management style, based on three principles: leading by example, open communication, and collaboration. I believe that a good manager should provide clear direction and guidance to their staff, communicate effectively with all stakeholders, and foster a cooperative, respectful and supportive work environment.

In my current role as Supervisor of the Kelowna-Vernon Regional Biosolids Compost Facility (RBCF), I have demonstrated strong leadership skills by managing a team of direct reports, including heavy equipment operators and environmental technicians, support staff, contractors, and consultants. I have developed and maintained capital plans and operating budgets, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements under the Organic Matter Recycling Regulation and the Environmental Management Act for compost operations. Additionally, I have facilitated meetings with and reported to the Kelowna-Vernon Biosolids Advisory Committee, which includes elected officials from Kelowna and Vernon. I have also provided regular feedback and coaching to my staff, mentoring them on their professional development and fostering a positive and respectful workplace culture.

As a result of my management style, I was able to achieve several outcomes that benefited both my team and the organization. For example:

🏭 "Leading by Example" - Successfully led a high-performing team of direct reports, contractors, and consultants to ensure compliance with operating plans, best practices, and guidelines, as well as operating permit requirements under the Organic Matter Recycling Regulation and the Environmental Management Act for compost operations.

💼 "Cost-conscious & Environmentally Responsible" - Demonstrated expertise in developing and evaluating bidding documents, internal control documents, and financial documents, considering cost-benefit, risk mitigation, and sustainable purchasing principles when evaluating proposals and negotiating contracts.

🤝 "Creating a Positive Work Culture" - Fostered a positive and respectful workplace culture, mentoring and developing team members, and effectively managing challenging employees, resulting in high satisfaction scores from your staff in a 2019 employee engagement survey.

🏢 "Ensuring Smooth Operations" - Made significant contributions to the development of the City's Asset Management Plan and the adoption of an asset management system (CityWorks) for our operation, leading to improved infrastructure asset decisions and minimized risk and cost while maximizing service delivery.

👃 "Improving Community Relations" - Achieved a 97% reduction in annual odour complaints by proactively improving neighbor relations through active listening, effective communication, and accommodating operational changes, resulting in praise from neighbors, management, and committee members.



====
A transformational management style is a type of leadership that focuses on creating an environment that supports innovation1. Leaders with this style often push their employees to set and reach goals even if it makes them slightly uncomfortable. These managers collaborate with and inspire direct reports to reach past their full potential and aim for professional growth12.

Transformational leaders are generally energetic, enthusiastic, and passionate3. They are not only concerned and involved in the process, but they are also focused on helping every member of the group succeed3. They provide encouragement, recognition, support, fairness, and integrity to their followers24.

Transformational leadership is a process where leaders and followers raise each other to higher levels of motivation and morality2. A good transformational leader does the following:

Provides a clear vision and direction for the organization
Communicates effectively and persuasively
Empowers employees to make decisions and take risks
Challenges themselves and their followers to grow and learn from mistakes
Models the desired behaviors and values
Recognizes and rewards achievements
Fosters a culture of trust, collaboration, and creativity1234

===
there are eight key management behaviors that stimulate the production of oxytocin and foster a culture of trust. These behaviors are:

1. Recognize excellence
2. Induce "challenge stress"
3. Give people discretion in how they do their work
4. Enable job crafting
5. Share information broadly
6. Intentionally build relationships
7. Facilitate whole-person growth
8. Show vulnerability

Jose's response to the presentation scenario:
In preparation for the interview, please prepare a 10 minute presentation on the following topic:
The RDNO SWMP states a target annual disposal rate of 350kg per person by 2028, which is almost 30% lower than the current rate of approximately 490kg.
DISPOSAL means going to landfill forever. So reduction strategies could include diversion to composting, digestion, EPR recycling, food waste prevention programs
Please provide an overview of three strategies that would make significant impacts in contributing to RDNO reaching its disposal rate by 2028 (in 5 years)

Definitions
•	Strategy: A broad, high-level plan outlining the overall approach and goals to be achieved.
•	Program: A set of related activities or initiatives designed to implement specific aspects of a strategy.
•	Action: Specific, measurable, and actionable steps or tasks that contribute to the implementation of a program.

JOSE'S 3 STRATEGIES 
 
Strategy 1: Expanding Food Waste Diversion
Goal: Increase the diversion of food waste from landfills, promote sustainable waste management practices, and support the circular economy.

Target diversion potential kg: 48kg (residential compostable) + 31 (ICI compostable) + 0 (self-haul) = 79kg

The following is a list of programs with individual actions
Strategy 2: Enhance Recycling and Waste Reduction Initiatives
Goal: Improve recycling rates, reduce waste generation, and support sustainable resource management practices.

Target diversion potential kg: includes EPR-PPP non-PPP and other recyclables: 12+5+3 (residential) +16+10+6 (ICI) +2+2+0 (self-haul) = 54kg

The following is a list of programs with individual actions
Strategy 3: Increase Building Material Diversion
Goal: Promote the reuse and recycling of building materials, reduce construction and demolition waste, and support sustainable resource management practices. 

Target diversion potential kg: 2 (residential) + 10 (ICI) + 3 (self-haul) = 15kg

Program 1: Implement Food Waste Bans
1.	Action 1: Implement a ban on disposing of food waste in garbage for the remaining RDNO member territories.
2.	Action 2: Enforce the ban on food waste disposal from Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional (ICI) sources, as outlined in the amended solid waste management bylaw.
Program 2: Expand Food Waste Collection Services
1.	Action 1: Consider expanding curbside pickup services for food waste to additional member municipalities within the RDNO.
2.	Action 2: Address the challenge of food waste disposal in remote areas by exploring options such as community composting sites or partnerships with local businesses that can serve as drop-off points.
Program 3: Education, Incentives, and Support
1.	Action 1: Educate residents and businesses about the importance of food waste diversion and provide guidance on how to properly compost or dispose of food waste.
2.	Action 2: Consider offering incentives, subsidies, or support programs to encourage food waste diversion, especially for ICI sources, multi-family dwellings, and rural communities.
Program 4: Monitoring and Evaluation
1.	Action 1: Monitor the effectiveness of the expanded food waste diversion program, including tracking diversion rates and evaluating the impact on overall waste reduction goals.
Program 5: Promoting Food Donations and Community Composting
1.	Action 1: Encourage and support ICI generators to donate surplus edible food to local food banks, shelters, and community organizations.
